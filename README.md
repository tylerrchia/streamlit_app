# My Streamlit Application - Tyler Chia

My streamlit application is used to give basic tools that help with an exploratory data analysis. It consists of the following tools:

1. A file uploader button to import your own csv file.
2. A button that allows you to choose if you want to display the uploaded data.
3. Simple statistics about the csv you uploaded such as number of rows, number of columns, number of numerical variables, etc.
4. An input widget that allows you to select a single column from the dataset.
5. A 5 number summary and a distribution plot if the selected column is numerical.
6. A barplot with the distribution of each category if the selected column is categorical.
7. All plots are customizable -- you can select a color, change the opacity, and change the titles.
8. All plots are also able to be downloaded with a download button.

In order to run the application, I recommend using a virtual environment. You can refer this website on different ways to run the application: **https://docs.streamlit.io/knowledge-base/using-streamlit/how-do-i-run-my-streamlit-script**
